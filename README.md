Google Maps V3 Marker Clusterer
==============================
This is a fork of Xiaoxi Wu's MarkerClusterer library for Google Maps V3.

The original repository can be found here: http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/markerclusterer/

**NOTE:** I will likely only be editing `src/markerclusterer.js`, since that's really the only part I care about. The docs, examples, images, and compiled version all came along when I forked from the original SVN repository.

Added Features
--------------

Coming soon...
